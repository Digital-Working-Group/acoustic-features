## Voice-Feature-Extraction-Toolkit
This repository contains examples of the usage of various voice feature extraction libraries and tools. Example files and docker containers are provided.
### opensmile
For usage of the openSMILE Python library (Python interface for extracting openSMILE features). openSMILE (open-source Speech and Music Interpretation by Large-space Extraction) is an open-source toolkit for audio analysis especially targeted at speech and music applications (e.g. automatic speech recognition, speaker identification, emotion recognition, etc.).
### jiwer_container
For usage of the JiWER Python library. JiWER is a python package to evaluate an automatic speech recognition system. JiWER supports the following measures: word error rate (WER), match error rate (MER), word information lost (WIL), word information preserved (WIP), and character error rate (CER).
### nltk_container
For usage of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) Python library. NLTK is a suite of open source Python modules, data sets, and tutorials supporting research and development in Natural Language Processing. See container's supported functionality [here](https://github.com/FHS-BAP/Voice-Feature-Extraction-Toolkit/blob/main/nltk_container/README.md#functions).
### spacy_container
For usage of spaCy (a Python library for advanced natural language processing). Container's functionality includes tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, lemmatization, sentence boundary location, and named entity recognition.
### speechbrain_container
For usage of SpeechBrain (open-source PyTorch toolkit for speech and text procesing). See container's supported functionality [here](https://github.com/FHS-BAP/Voice-Feature-Extraction-Toolkit/blob/main/speechbrain_container/README.md#supported-tasks).
### 2vec
For processing files using models of the transformers Python library, specifically [Data2Vec](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/data2vec) and [Wav2Vec](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/wav2vec2) (models developed by Meta AI).
### espnet_example
For usage of the ESPnet Python library. ESPnet is an end-to-end speech processing toolkit. Container functionality includes transcription and diarization.
